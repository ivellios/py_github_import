# Github Python import hook

Did you know you can define how Python imports the code? Import hooks allow to overwrite it's behaviour and let you define your own sources for loading the Python code.

This repository is an example of a hook that allows loading python files directly from Github. No more clonning, no installing of the packages.

That may not work in some cases. It was tested with simple cases just to prove the concept. 

## Use manual

1. Clone
1. Run: `python import_test.py`
1. Read the code for your viewing pleasure
